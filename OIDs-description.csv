Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect<br/>

stations must be prepared to receive tabular information<br/>

examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object.<br/>

This object represents the administratively-configured type of the MAU. If auto-negotiation is not enabled or is not<br/>

NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS: It may be necessary to provide for underlying hardware implementations which do not follow the exact behavior specified above. In particular, when ifMauAutoNegAdminStatus transitions from enabled to disabled, the agent implementation MUST ensure that the operational type of the MAU (as reported by ifMauType) correctly transitions to the value specified by this object, rather than continuing to operate at the value earlier determined by the auto-negotiation function.""<br/>

component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling<br/>
components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the<br/>

An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering<br/>
for all sibling components of a particular parent<br/>
(identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each<br/>
sibling entry).<br/>
If possible, this value should match any external labeling<br/>
of the physical component. For example, for a container<br/>
(e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3',<br/>
entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note<br/>
that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3<br/>
should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'.<br/>
If the physical position of this component does not match<br/>
any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then<br/>
user documentation or other external reference material<br/>
should be used to determine the parent-relative position.<br/>
If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a<br/>
consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set<br/>
of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal<br/>
representation of the components.<br/>
If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position<br/>
for some reason, or if the associated value of<br/>
entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is<br/>
returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned,<br/>
indicating the parent-relative position of this physical<br/>
entity.<br/>
Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and<br/>
continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest<br/>
positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities<br/>
(e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero,<br/>
then the first sibling should be associated with an<br/>
entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this<br/>
ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent<br/>
implementation.<br/>
The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as<br/>
each 'parent' component may use different numbering<br/>
algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings<br/>
of the same parent component.<br/>
The agent should retain parent-relative position values<br/>

of non-volatile storage.""</code>]"
